# IWTI (I Want That Inventory)

is a simple rust program that takes a csgo item or inventory and parses that into Osiris' skin format.

(This is not a cheat please dont google what osiris is it is definitely not an open source csgo cheat)
(I am definitely not developing csgo cheats nononono definitely not)
